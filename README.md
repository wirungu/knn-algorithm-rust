# k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm in Rust

This repository contains an initial implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using Rust. This is going to be part of a simple Rust library I'm working on that implements some common machine learning algorithms including simple classifiers and clustering algorithms.
