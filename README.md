# k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm in Rust

I'm working on a Rust library that implements some common machine learning algorithms including simple classifiers and clustering algorithms, and this repository contains an initial implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm using Rust, just so I get the logic right.
